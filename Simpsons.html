          <p>The Simpsons is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company. <br>
The series is a satirical depiction of American life, epitomized by the Simpson family, which consists <br>
of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield and parodies <br>
American culture and society, television, and the human condition.</p>

   <p>The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of animated shorts with <br>
producer James L. Brooks. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after his own <br>
family members, substituting Bart for his own name; he thought Simpson was a funny name in that it had <br>
the word "simp" in it, which is short for "simpleton". The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show <br>
on April 19, 1987. After three seasons, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and became <br>
Fox's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989â€“1990).</p>

   <p>Since its debut on December 17, 1989, 687 episodes of The Simpsons have been broadcast. It is the longest-running <br>
American sitcom, and the longest-running American scripted primetime television series, both in terms of seasons <br>
and number of episodes. A feature-length film, The Simpsons Movie, was released in theaters worldwide on July 27, 2007, <br>
and grossed over $527 million. On October 30, 2007, a video game was released. The Simpsons was renewed on February 6, 2019 <br>
for a thirty-first and thirty-second season. The former began airing September 29, 2019 and concluded on May 17, 2020; the <br>
latter will include the 700th episode. The Simpsons is a joint production by Gracie Films and 20th Television.</p>

   <p>The Simpsons received acclaim throughout its first nine or ten seasons, which are generally considered its "Golden Age", <br>
though it has also been criticized for a perceived decline in quality since then. Time named it the 20th century's best <br>
television series, and Erik Adams of The A.V. Club named it "television's crowning achievement regardless of format". <br>
On January 14, 2000, the Simpson family was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It has won dozens of awards since <br> 
it debuted as a series, including 34 Primetime Emmy Awards, 34 Annie Awards, and 2 Peabody Awards. Homer's exclamatory catchphrase <br> 
"D'oh!" has been adopted into the English language, while The Simpsons has influenced many other later adult-oriented animated sitcoms.</p>
