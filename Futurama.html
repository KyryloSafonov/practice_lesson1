           <p>Futurama is an American animated science fiction television series created by Matt Groening that aired on Fox <br>
        from March 28, 1999 to August 10, 2003 and on Comedy Central from March 23, 2008 to September 4, 2013. The series <br>
        follows the adventures of slacker Philip J. Fry, who is cryogenically preserved for 1000 years and is revived in the  <br>
        31st century. Fry finds work at an interplanetary delivery company, working alongside the one-eyed Turanga Leela and <br>
        robot Bender Bending Rodriguez. The series was envisioned by Groening in the mid-1990s while working on The Simpsons; <br>
        he brought David X. Cohen aboard to develop storylines and characters to pitch the show to Fox.</p>
        
           <p>Following its initial cancellation by Fox, Futurama began airing reruns on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim programming block, <br>
        which lasted from 2003 to 2007. It was revived that year as four direct-to-video films, the last of which was released in <br>
        early 2009. Comedy Central entered into an agreement with 20th Century Fox Television to syndicate the existing episodes <br>
        and air the films as 16 new, half-hour episodes, constituting a fifth season.</p>
        
           <p>In June 2009, Comedy Central picked up the show for 26 new half-hour episodes, which began airing in 2010 and 2011. <br>
        The show was renewed for a final, seventh season, with the first half airing in 2012 and the second in 2013. <br>
        An audio-only episode featuring the original cast members was released in 2017 as an episode of The Nerdist Podcast.</p>
        
           <p>Futurama received critical acclaim throughout its run and was nominated for 17 Annie Awards, winning seven, and 12 <br> 
        Emmy Awards, winning six. It was nominated four times for a Writers Guild of America Award, winning for the episodes <br>
        "Godfellas" and "The Prisoner of Benda". It was nominated for a Nebula Award and received Environmental Media Awards <br>
        for the episodes "The Problem with Popplers" and "The Futurama Holiday Spectacular". Merchandise includes a tie-in <br>
        comic book series, video games, calendars, clothes and figurines. In 2013, TV Guide ranked Futurama one of the top 60 <br>
        Greatest TV Cartoons of All Time.</p>
