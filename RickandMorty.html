        <p> Rick and Morty is an American adult animated science fiction sitcom created by Justin Roiland <br>
and Dan Harmon for Cartoon Network's late-night programming block Adult Swim. The series follows <br>
the misadventures of cynical mad scientist Rick Sanchez and his good-hearted but fretful grandson <br>
Morty Smith, who split their time between domestic life and interdimensional adventures.</p>

   <p>Roiland voices the eponymous characters, with Chris Parnell, Spencer Grammer and Sarah Chalke voicing <br>
the rest of Rick and Morty's family. The series originated from an animated short parody film of Back <br>
to the Future, created by Roiland for Channel 101, a short film festival co-founded by Harmon. The series <br>
has been acclaimed by critics for its originality, creativity and humor.</p>

   <p>The fourth season premiered on November 10, 2019, and consists of ten episodes. <br>
A fifth season was confirmed in May 2020, as part of a long-term deal in May 2018 <br>
that ordered 70 new episodes over an unspecified number of seasons.</p>
